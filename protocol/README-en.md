  <h2>Welcome to the Baseline Testing Session for the Mumble Melody Longitudinal Study on Stuttering</h2>
  <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this study. We are researchers from MIT working to expand research on audio-based approaches that may help increase fluency for adults who stutter.

    <h3>About this Session</h3>
    <p>Today, we will do an initial testing session consisting of a baseline assessment of your fluency and an initial assessment using four feedback modes: unaltered voice, reverb, whisper, and harmony. With those modes, you will hear your voice altered. The study aims to investigate whether those auditory feedback modes can increase fluency in people who stutter in the long term.<br><br>Here is how the session will take place today:
<br>(1) First, we will ask you a few questions
<br>(2) Next, we will ask you to do a volume check to ensure recording quality
<br>(3) Next, we will establish your fluency baseline with a series of open questions
<br>(4) Next, we will guide you through the process of downloading, setting up, and using the Mumble Melody app. You will need the wired headphones and lightning-to-headphone-jack adapter we have shipped you. You will also need your iOS device to use the Mumble Melody app.
<br>(5) Next, we will use different feedback modes which will change the way you hear your own voice. There are 4 modes and for each of them we will do a shortened version of the fluency assessment test
<br>(6) Finally, we will ask you a few interview questions to get your feedback about the whole experience.

    <h3>Ready to Get Started?</h3>
    <p>To begin, please make sure that you are sitting somewhere comfortable and quiet, where you feel like you can speak out loud and converse. During this session, you will be speaking into your device, and us researchers will be analyzing your submitted recordings. You may use the same iOS device that you indicated on your prior form for operating the Application, or a separate device that you would like to use to record your session. In either case, make sure you are using a device that you would like to use for future sessions. Additionally, make sure that your device is connected to either the internet or cellular data.<br><br> This screening session will be about 30 to 40 minutes long.
