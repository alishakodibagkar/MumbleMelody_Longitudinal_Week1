Take a moment to turn the “Unaltered” mode on, test it by repeating a few words out loud (for example, “Testing 1, 2, 3”) and adjust your volume button until you comfortably can hear your voice in your headphones. The “Unaltered” mode will play back your unaltered voice. Try to refrain from using the other modes. Click Continue when you are able to hear your voice through this mode.",
